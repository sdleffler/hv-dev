//! # Heavy Elastic - almost-safe abstractions for "stretching" lifetimes (and dealing with what
//! happens when they have to snap back.)
//!
//! This crate provides six main abstractions:
//! - [`Stretchable<'a>`], a trait indicating that some type with a lifetime `'a` can have that
//!   lifetime `'a` *removed* (and virtually set to `'static`.)
//! - [`Stretched`], an unsafe trait denoting that a type is a stretched version of a
//!   [`Stretchable<'a>`] type.
//! - [`Elastic<T>`], a `'static` "slot" which can be temporarily loaned a non-`'static` value.
//! - [`ScopeGuard`], a collection allocated in a [`ScopeArena`] which gathers [`ElasticGuard`]s and
//!   ensures that they are not mishandled.
//! - [`ScopeArena`], an arena allocator specialized for safely allocating [`ScopeGuard`]s.
//! - [`ElasticGuard<'a, T>`], a guard which takes on the lifetime of loans to an [`Elastic`] and
//!   handles expiring the loans.
//!
//! Requires nightly for `#![feature(generic_associated_types, allocator_api)]`.
//!
//! # Why would I want this?
//!
//! `Elastic` excels at "re-loaning" objects across "`'static` boundaries" and "`Send` boundaries".
//! For example, the Rust standard library's [`std::thread::spawn`] function requires that the
//! `FnOnce` closure you use to start a new thread is `Send + 'static`. I'm calling this a
//! "`'static` boundary" because it effectively partitions your code into two different sets of
//! lifetimes - the lifetimes on the parent thread, and the lifetimes on the child thread, and
//! you're forced to separate these because of a `'static` bound on the closure. So what happens if
//! you need to send over a reference to something which isn't `'static`? Without unsafe
//! abstractions or refactoring to remove the lifetime (which in some cases won't be possible
//! because the type isn't from your crate in the first place) you're, generally speaking, screwed.
//! `Elastic` lets you get around this problem by providing a "slot" which can have a value safely
//! and remotely loaned to it.
//!
//! ## Using `Elastic` for crossing `Send + 'static` boundaries
//!
//! Let's first look at the problem without `Elastic`:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use core::cell::RefCell;
//! let my_special_u32 = RefCell::new(23);
//!
//! // This fails for two reasons: first, RefCell is not Sync, so it's unsafe to Send any kind
//! // of reference to it across a thread boundary. Second, the `&'a mut RefCell<u32>` created
//! // implicitly by this closure borrowing its environment is non-static.
//! std::thread::spawn(|| {
//!     *my_special_u32.borrow_mut() *= 3;
//! }).join().unwrap();
//!
//! // We know that the thread will have returned by now thanks to the use of `.join()`, but
//! // the borrowchecker has no way of proving that! Which is why it requires the closure to be
//! // static in the first place.
//! let important_computed_value = *my_special_u32.borrow() * 6 + 6;
//! ```
//!
//! If you're stuck with a [`RefCell<T>`], it may be hard to see a way to get a mutable reference to
//! its contained value across a combined `'static + Send` boundary. However, with [`Elastic`], you
//! can deal with the situation cleanly, no matter where the `&'a mut T` comes from:
//!
//! ```
//! # use hv_elastic::{ElasticMut, ScopeArena};
//! # use core::cell::RefCell;
//! # let my_special_u32 = RefCell::new(23);
//! // Create an empty "scope arena", which we need for allocating scope guards.
//! let mut scope_arena = ScopeArena::new();
//! // Create an empty elastic which expects to be loaned an `&'a mut u32`.
//! let empty_elastic = ElasticMut::<u32>::new();
//!
//! {
//!     // Elastics are shared, using an Arc under the hood. Cloning them is cheap
//!     // and does not clone any data inside.
//!     let shared_elastic = empty_elastic.clone();
//!     let mut refcell_guard = my_special_u32.borrow_mut();
//!     scope_arena.scope(|guard| {
//!         // If you can get an `&'a mut T` out of it, you can loan it to an `ElasticMut<T>`.
//!         guard.loan(&shared_elastic, &mut *refcell_guard);
//!
//!         // Spawn a thread to do some computation with our borrowed u32, and take ownership of
//!         // the clone we made of our Elastic.
//!         std::thread::spawn(move || {
//!             // Internally, `Elastic` contains an atomic refcell. This is necessary for safety,
//!             // so unfortunately we have to suck it up and take the extra verbosity.
//!             *shared_elastic.borrow_mut() *= 3;
//!         }).join().unwrap();
//!
//!         // At the end of this scope, the borrowed reference is forcibly removed from the
//!         // shared Elastic, and the lifetime bounds on `scope` ensure that the refcell guard is
//!         // still valid at this point. However, the value inside the refcell has long since been
//!         // modified by our spawned thread!
//!     });
//!
//!     // Now, the refcell guard drops.
//! }
//!
//! // The elastic never took ownership of the refcell or the value inside in any way - it was
//! // temporarily loaned an `&'a mut u32` which came from inside a `core::cell::RefMut<'a, u32>`
//! // and did any modifications directly on that reference. So code "after" any elastic
//! // manipulation looks exactly the same as before - no awkward wrappers or anything.
//! let important_computed_value = *my_special_u32.borrow() * 6 + 6;
//!
//! // With the current design of Elastic, the scope arena will not automagically release the memory
//! // it allocated, so if it's used in a loop, you'll probably want to call `.reset()` occasionally
//! // to release the memory used to allocate the scope guards:
//! scope_arena.reset();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Using `Elastic` for enabling dynamic typing with non-`'static` values
//!
//! Rust's [`Any`](core::any::Any) trait is an invaluable tool for writing code which doesn't always
//! have static knowledge of the types involved. However, when it comes to lifetimes, the question
//! of how to handle dynamic typing is complex and unresolved. Should a `Foo<'a>` have a different
//! type ID from a `Foo<'static>`? As the thread discussing this is the greatest thread in the
//! history of forums, locked by a moderator after 12,239 pages of heated debate, (it was not and I
//! am not aware of any such thread; this is a joke) [`Any`](core::any::Any) has a `'static` bound
//! on it. Which is very inconvenient if what you want to do is completely *ignore* any lifetimes in
//! your dynamically typed code by treating them as if they're all equal (and/or `'static`.)
//!
//! Elastic can help here. If the type you want to stick into an `Any` is an `&T` or `&mut T`, it's
//! very straightforward as [`ElasticRef<T>`] and [`ElasticMut<T>`] are both `'static`. If the type
//! you have is not a plain old reference, it's a bit nastier; you need to ensure the safety of
//! lifetime manipulation on the type in question, and then manually construct a type which
//! represents (as plain old data) a lifetime-erased version of that type. Then, manually implement
//! [`Stretched`] and [`Stretchable`] on it. This is ***highly*** unsafe! Please take special care
//! to respect the requirements on implementations of `Stretchable`. Size and alignment of the
//! stretched type must match. This is pretty much the only requirement though. The
//! [`impl_stretched_methods`] macro exists to help you safely implement the methods required by
//! `Stretched` once you ensure the lifetimes are correct. Just note that it does this by swinging
//! a giant hammer named [`core::mem::transmute`], and it does this *by design*, and that **if you
//! screw up on the lifetime safety requirements you are headed on a one way trip to
//! Undefinedbehaviortown.**
//!
//! ## Yes, there are twelve different ways to borrow from an `Elastic`, and every single one is useful
//!
//! How may I borrow from thee? Well, let me count the ways:
//!
//! ### Dereferenced borrows (the kind you want most of the time)
//!
//! Eight of the borrow methods are "dereferenced" - they expect you to be stretching references or
//! smart pointers/guards with lifetimes in them. If you're using [`ElasticRef`]/[`ElasticMut`] or
//! [`StretchedRef`]/[`StretchedMut`], these are what you want; they're much more convenient than
//! the parameterized borrows.
//!
//! - [`Elastic::borrow`] and [`Elastic::borrow_mut`]; most of the time, if you're working with
//!   references being extended, and you don't care about handling borrow errors, you'll use these.
//!   99% of the time, they do what you want, and you're probably going to be enforcing invariants
//!   to make sure it wouldn't error anyways. These are the [`Elastic`] versions of
//!   [`RefCell::borrow`] and [`RefCell::borrow_mut`], and they pretty much behave identicaly.
//! - [`Elastic::borrow_arc`] and [`Elastic::borrow_arc_mut`]; these come from the [`ArcCell`] which
//!   lives inside an [`Elastic`], and offer guards juts like `borrow` and `borrow_mut` *but*, those
//!   guards are reference counted and don't have a lifetime attached. So instead of
//!   [`AtomicRef<'a, T>`], you get [`ArcRef<T>`], which has the same lifetime as `T`... and if `T`
//!   is `'static`, so is [`ArcRef<T>`]/[`ArcRefMut<T>`], which can be very useful, again for
//!   passing across `Send`/`'static`/whatnot boundaries.
//! - [`Elastic::try_borrow`], [`Elastic::try_borrow_mut`], [`Elastic::try_borrow_arc`],
//!   [`Elastic::try_borrow_arc_mut`]; these are just versions of the four
//!   `borrow`/`borrow_mut`/`borrow_arc`/`borrow_arc_mut` methods which don't panic on failure, and
//!   return `Result` instead.
//!
//! ### Parameterized borrows (you're in the deep end, now)
//!
//! The last four methods are what the other eight are all implemented on. These return `Result`
//! instead of panicking, and provide direct access to whatever [`T::Parameterized<'a>`] is. In the
//! case of [`StretchedRef`] and [`StretchedMut`], we have `<StretchedRef<T>>::Parameterized<'a> =
//! &'a T` and `<StretchedMut<T>>::Parameterized<'a> = &'a mut T`; when we use a method like
//! [`Elastic::try_borrow_as_parameterized_mut`] on an [`Elastic<StretchedMut<T>>`], we'll get back
//! `Result<AtomicRefMut<'_, &'_ mut T>, BorrowMutError>` which is pretty obviously redundant. It's
//! for this reason that the other eight methods exist to handle the common cases and abstract away
//! the fact that [`Elastic`] is more than just an [`AtomicRefCell`].
//!
//! # Safety: [`ElasticGuard`], [`ScopeGuard`] and [`ScopeArena`]
//!
//! [`Elastic`] works by erasing the lifetime on the type and then leaving you with an
//! [`ElasticGuard<'a>`] which preserves the lifetime. This [`ElasticGuard`] is a "drop guard" - in
//! its [`Drop`] implementation, it tries to take back the loaned value, preventing it from being
//! used after the loan expires. There are a couple ways this can go wrong:
//!
//! 1. If [`Elastic`] is currently borrowed when the guard drops, a panic will occur, because the
//!    guard's drop impl needs mutable access to the "slot" inside the [`Elastic`].
//! 2. If you [`core::mem::forget`] the [`ElasticGuard`], the slot inside the [`Elastic`] will never
//!    be cleared, which is *highly* unsafe, as you now have a stretched value running around which
//!    is no longer bounded by any lifetime. This is a recipe for undefined behavior and
//!    use-after-free bugs.
//!
//! The first error case is unavoidable; if you're loaning stuff out, you might have to drop
//! something while it's in use. To avoid this, loaning should be done in phases; loan a bunch of
//! things at once, ensure whatever is using those loans finishes, and then expire those loans.
//! Thankfully, the solution to making this easy *and* avoiding the possibility of the second
//! failure mode can exist in one primitive: [`ScopeArena`]. [`ScopeArena`] provides a method
//! [`ScopeArena::scope`], which allows you to create scopes in which a [`ScopeGuard`] takes
//! ownership of the [`ElasticGuard`]s produced by the loaning operation. Since the [`ScopeGuard`]
//! is owned by the caller - [`ScopeArena::scope`] - the user cannot accidentally or intentionally
//! [`core::mem::forget`] a guard, and in addition, the guard ensures that all of the loans made to
//! it have the same parameterized lifetime, which encourages the phase-loaning pattern.
//!
//! In short, *always use [`ScopeArena`] and [`ScopeGuard`] - if you think you have to use
//! [`ElasticGuard`] for some reason, double check!*

///
/// ## Requirement #1: Do not use `'static` or references to represent your stretched type!
///
/// ***DEPENDING ON YOUR TYPE, IT MAY BE UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR TO ACTUALLY HAVE IT REPRESENTED WITH THE
/// PARAMETERIZED LIFETIME SUBSTITUTED WITH `'static`!*** The Rust aliasing rules state that if you

/// rest of the lifetime, even if you get rid of the value and it is no longer touched!*** Instead
/// of using `'static` lifetimes to represent a stretched thing, use pointers, or - horror of
/// horrors - implement `Stretched` for something like:
///
/// ```
/// # #![feature(generic_associated_types)]
/// # use hv_elastic::{Stretched, Stretchable};
/// # pub struct MyType<'a>(&'a ());
///
/// pub struct StretchedMyType {
///     // An array of bytes gives us the exact size of the type we're stretching.
///     _data: [u8; std::mem::size_of::<MyType>()],
///     // And, a zero-sized array of a `'static` version of the type we're stretching gives us
///     // the required alignment. Because it's a zero-sized array, no values of the type
///     // `MyType<'static>` actually end up existing, so it's safe to use `'static` here.
///     _force_align: [MyType<'static>; 0],
/// }
///
/// // It is recommended to use `static_assertions` and always follow a definition like this with
/// // assertions that the alignment and size match, as required by the `Stretched` trait.
/// static_assertions::assert_eq_align!(MyType<'static>, StretchedMyType);
/// static_assertions::assert_eq_size!(MyType<'static>, StretchedMyType);
///
/// unsafe impl Stretched for StretchedMyType {
///     type Parameterized<'a> = MyType<'a>;
///
///     hv_elastic::impl_stretched_methods!();
/// }
///
/// impl<'a> Stretchable<'a> for MyType<'a> {
///     type Stretched = StretchedMyType;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This creates a piece of plain old data with the same size and byte alignment as your type. Yes,
/// this will work. And yes, it is a much safer option/will not cause undefined behavior, unlike
/// having `&'static MyType` around and having Rust assume that the thing it pointed to will never,
/// ever be mutated again. **DO NOT NEEDLESSLY ANTAGONIZE THE RUST COMPILER! THE CRAB WILL NOT
/// FORGIVE YOU!**
///
/// ## Requirement #2: Your stretchable type must be covariant over the parameterized lifetime!
///
/// A type which is stretchable is parameterized over a lifetime. *It **must** be covariant over
/// that lifetime.* The reason for this is that essentially the `Stretched` trait and [`Elastic`]
/// allow you to *decouple two lifetimes at a number of "decoupled reborrows".* The first lifetime
/// here is the lifetime of the original data, which is carried over in [`ElasticGuard`];
/// [`ElasticGuard`] ensures that the data is dropped at or before the end of its lifetime (and if
/// it can't, everything will blow up with a panic.) The second lifetime is the lifetime of every
/// borrow from the [`Elastic`]. As such what [`Elastic`] and [`Stretchable`] actually allow you to
/// do is tell Rust to *assume* that the reborrowed lifetimes are all outlived by the original
/// lifetime, and blow up/error if not. This should scare you shitless. However, I am unstoppable
/// and I won't do what you tell me.

/// `'static`, [`Elastic<T>`] is always `'static` and can be used to access non-`'static` types
/// safely from contexts which require `'static` (such as dynamic typing with `Any` or the
/// `hv-alchemy` crate.) The lifetime is preserved by a scope guard, [`ElasticGuard`], which is
/// provided when a value is loaned and which revokes the loan when it is dropped or has the loaned
/// value forcibly taken back by [`ElasticGuard::take`]. In most cases, you won't actually see these
/// [`ElasticGuard`]s as they'll be created and stashed away by a [`ScopeGuard`], which you should
/// be using to perform all your loans.
///
/// [`Elastic<T>`] is thread-safe. However, internally, it uses an

/// dropping the guard: the guard will panic if it cannot take back the value.
///
/// # Soundness
///
/// As long as you fulfill its requirements with respect to its guards, `Elastic` is sound in all

///
/// - If an elastic exists on one thread and is being loaned to with a guard on another thread, and

///   thread. Most likely, the thread holding the guard will attempt to drop the guard, which will
///   then cause the guard's `Drop` impl to panic, which will then cause an abort (as panicking
///   during a panick will cause an abort.) However, if the panic *starts* in the guard's `Drop`
///   impl, and the guard is handling a reference which has been loaned to it, it is possible that
///   the original owner of the data being borrowed there could be dropped, *while* the other thread
///   is holding an open borrow on a reference to that data. Since this lib is `no_std`, we cannot
///   `std::process::abort()`. We may be able to consider this soundness hole plugged by marking
///   this type `!UnwindSafe` or requiring that stretched types be `UnwindSafe`; this is an open
